# :tada: Minimum Safes to Destroy

You are given `n` safes, each of which can be opened using a specific key or destroyed to access its contents. The keys to these safes are also stored in safes. Each safe can contain one or more keys, or it may not have any keys at all. It is known which safe contains the key that fits another safe.
The task is to write a program that determines the minimum number of safes that need to be destroyed to access the contents of all the safes.

## :rocket: Usage

- `make run` - compiles and runs the main program.
- `make test` - compiles and runs the sample tests place in **/tests** directory.
